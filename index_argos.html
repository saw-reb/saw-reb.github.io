            <h2>PERSONALITY</h2>
            <p>Argos Tav is one of the most devout followers of the Path of Light you'll ever see. He's devoted his entire life towards  enlightenment, studying history and culture alongside his fellow monstrous monks. He is calm and level-headed, but is tough enough to kick ass when the situation calls for it. As long as you don't get on his bad side, he will remain loyal to you until death.</p>
            <h2>BACKSTORY</h2>
            <p>Monsters have never been looked upon kindly in Argos' world. They are hunted mercilessly, enslaved endlessly, and exiled globally. There are very few safe places in the world for creatures like Argos, one of them being his monastery. It's a place for monsters of all kinds to live in peace as acolytes of the Path of Light. Argos grew up as a devoted student of self-improvement, but also learned how to defend himself and his allies, and is now a powerful leader in the fight for monster acceptance, equity, and inclusion.</p>
