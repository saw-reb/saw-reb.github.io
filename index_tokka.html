            <h2>PERSONALITY</h2>
            <p>Tokka Heldgarr may look intimidating due to his orcish stature and sharp teeth, but he's one of the sweetest folks you'll ever meet! He's a devoted family man and a loyal friend. When he's not adventuring, you can probably find him serving working at his bakery, <i>Tusks and Treats!</i> In addition to being a master of the eldritch arts, he also loves dad jokes! Much to his party's dismay, of course.</p> </i> 
            <h2>BACKSTORY</h2>
            <p>As a child, Tokka lived in a peaceful village surrounded by a thick and magical forest. He loved exploring the woods, and his frolicking eventually led him to discover a small civilization of fairies. He befriended them quickly, and they showed him their culture and magic. One day, his village was violently raided, so he fled to the woods to look for help. The fairies loved him, so they granted him magic, allowing him to defend the village. He's been strengthening his bond with the fairies and practicing his eldritch abilities ever since!</p>
