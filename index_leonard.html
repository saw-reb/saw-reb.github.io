            <h2>PERSONALITY</h2>
            <p>Leonard is a no-nonsense soldier with one goal in mind at all times: to get his job done. He's not a fan of needless violence and will only attack if necessary, but when he does attack, you better watch out! He's also easily annoyed, and hates when his party members dilly-dally for no reason. He can be a bit stuffy at times, but as long as you're on his side, he will defend you to the very end.</p>
            <h2>STORY</h2>
            <p>Leonard is unique from the other characters in this archive due to his limited nature. He was created for a dungeon-crawling one-shot, but has become so much more than that. During our dungeon crawl, our party encountered a mysterious and magical fountain. It wasn't until one of our players saved the life of another in a selfless act that the fountain granted us one wish. What did Leonard wish for? Well, to ascend to godhood, of course! He instantly jumped to level 20 and is now a revered deity of his hometown.</p>
