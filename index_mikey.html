            <h2>PERSONALITY</h2>
            <p>Mikey's a simple guy, trying to make his way through the world. He's rather timid, but he's a fast learner and a loyal friend(not to mention super sneaky), making him a useful asset on any team! He's in love with the open sky, and hopes to have his own spaceship one day so he can explore the stars. His favorite hobbies include collecting parts and repairing assorted space vehicles.</p>
            <h2>BACKSTORY</h2>
            <p>Born on a ship known as Fortune's Fury, Mikey grew up in a large family of galactic travelers and pirates! His mother was the great Captain Imelda Price, who supported him through both his gender transition and his dreams of becoming a star sailor. Unfortunately, when he was a child, the ship was raided and his mother was arrested after she sent him away in an escape pod. He wandered the planet of Tira for years, looking for odd jobs and places to stay. He doesn't know where his family is now, but he's determined to find them!</p>
