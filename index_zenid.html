            <h2>PERSONALITY</h2>
            <p>To many, Zenid may appear standoffish, but the truth is that he's simply introverted. On the rare occasion that he joins a conversation, he never lies and will speak his mind to the best of his ability. He's highly intelligent and observant(though he keeps most observations to himself), and loves learning new things. Unfortunately, he's not exactly the best at expressing his emotions.</p>
            <h2>BACKSTORY</h2>
            <p>Dragonborns are not always looked upon with fondness in modern society. They can be intimidating at times, even when they're young, and Zenid's asocial mannerisms didn't exactly endear him to many of those around him. When he was a child, his parents tried to raise him like any other, but he never fit in and was eventually exiled after accidentally spilling his acid breath on other kids. His parents raised him alone in the forest to protect him from those who sought to hurt him, and once he was skilled enough, he ventured out on his own.</p>
