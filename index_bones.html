            <h2>PERSONALITY</h2>
            <p>Wisecracking and bone-crackling, it's Bones Malone, the undead boss of the spookiest mob in town! What he lacks in flesh, he makes up for in agility and street smarts. No matter how dire the situation may be, Bones can usually be found making jokes. He doesn't take a lot of things seriously, which can be annoying to his partners, but you gotta admit he's one sharp shooter!</p>
            <h2>BACKSTORY</h2>
            <p>Bones Malone was born Stanley Mallorini, and led one of the most infamous mobs in town. His crew got up to all sorts of mischief, which unfortunately caught lots of attention both from the law and from rival groups. One fateful night, a rival agent set fire to the Mallorini mansion and Stanley was killed...or so everyone thought. His body was reduced to a skeleton, but his willpower was so powerful that his spirit remained! He changed his name to Bones because he thought it was funny, and now seeks to avenge himself and his family.</p>
