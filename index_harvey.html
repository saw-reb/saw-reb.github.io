            <h2>PERSONALITY</h2>
            <p>Imagine a classic cowboy, but instead of riding a horse, he <i>is</i> the horse. That's Harvey, the rootin' tootin' ranger! He's strong and fast, but gentle to the creatures in his care. He always finds a way to make light of a dire situation, but that doesn't mean he's not taking it seriously--he just wants to make everyone comfortable! Perhaps that's why he's such a great beast wrangler.</p>
            <h2>BACKSTORY</h2>
            <p>Harvey grew up on his family's ranch alongside a large group of siblings, cousins, and elders, each with their own unique job. He was in charge of feeding, cleaning, and loving all the family's creatures, and he was sure good at it! Unfortunately, one day a terrible plague began to flow through the water, poisoning any animal that drank it. Many of the Clydes' beasts made it after some veterinarian work, but Harvey knew something bigger was going on. He knew he had to protect his beloved animals, so he left the ranch in search of answers.</p>
