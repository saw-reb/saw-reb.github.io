            <h2>PERSONALITY</h2>
            <p>Riknash is a free spirit who refuses to let others hurt him or his fellow reptiles. He may be lighthearted and fun, but don't mistake his sunny disposition for naivety or carelessness. Riknash is fiercely devoted to protecting and serving his fellow sewer-dwellers. He's modest, but many see him as a guardian angel. Be kind to those who lurk beneath, and he'll be your ally for life!</p>
            <h2>BACKSTORY</h2>
            <p>Riknash wasn't always the walking, talking crocodile we know and love. For the first few years of his live, he was just like any other subterranean swimmer. But the land-dwellers who lived above him kept polluting the waters below and creating a terrible environment for him and his community. Riknash was stronger than most, so he helped out where he could. This caught the eye of the god Sobek, who blessed him with divine power and a new body. Because of his selfless and holy deeds, Riknash is now a figure of hope in sewer systems across the nation.</p>
